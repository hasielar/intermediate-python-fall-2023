    "1. **Modularity**- Modular programming is the action of breaking down a large, unmanageable tasks, into smaller, meaningful, and manageable subtasks or modules. The modules can then stick together and create packages.\n",
    "    * Simplicity - You will have much smaller problems to solve rather than tweaking and tinkering with the entire problem at once.\n",
    "    * Maintanability - Modules are kept separate and bound by logical parts. It is easier for you and your collaborators to work on logical smaller modules rather than working on big chunks of code that has no simple way to be understood.\n",
    "    * Reusability - Functions and objects can be accessed easily. This eliminates the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "2. **Documentation** - Shows how to use your project, reduce confusion for your collaborators, and frustration for the future *you*. Being able to document your own code gives you confidence that you understand it yourself. A sign of well-written code is that it is well documented!\n",
    "3. **Testing** - Save time over manual testing, find and fix more bugs, and run tests whenever you want. You can create a **manual** or **automated** test depending on the scope of your project.\n",
    "    * Manual testing - Exploratory or manual testing is/are the test(s) you do without any plan. Basically you are just exploring your code.\n",
    "    * Automated testing - The test(s) you do with a plan and checklists. A checklist can be anything such as your features and parts that need to be carefully executed."
